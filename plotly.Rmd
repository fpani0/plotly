## Plot Cars

The data in the following chart shows the the speed of cars and the distances taken to stop.  A regression line is fitted to the data.  The data was recorded in the 1920s and is part of the R distribution packages by default.  See ?cars

## Distance stopped vrs speed of car

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(plotly)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}

fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)

x <- list(
    title = "Speed"
)
y <- list(
    title = "Distance"
)

plot_ly(cars, x = cars$speed, y = cars$dist, type="scatter", mode = "markers") %>% 
  layout(xaxis = x, yaxis = y) %>% 
  add_trace(data = cars, x = cars$speed, y = fitted(fit), mode = "lines", name="blah")
```

## Thank you
